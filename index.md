## What is a Game Jam?
A Game Jam is typically a 48-hour event held over a weekend (yes, you're allowed to sleep!) where people come together to create games in a short amount of time.
It's a fantastic opportunity to experiment, unleash your creativity, meet like-minded people, and just have fun. There's no pressure to produce a polished or complete game â€” the experience itself is valuable, whether you finish or not!

## The Three Pillars of Game Development

This guide is organized around three key areas essential to making a game:

### ðŸŽ® Game Design  
Game design is not about graphics â€” itâ€™s about defining the gameplay, mechanics, goals, characters, and player experience.

### ðŸ’» Coding  
How the game is implemented. This guide doesnâ€™t go deep into code examples, but instead highlights concepts like organizing your project and using common programming patterns.

### ðŸŽ¨ðŸŽµ Assets  
Everything visual and audio â€” including sprites, sound effects, music, and anything else that makes your game come alive.
