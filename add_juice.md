# ✨ Add "Juice" ✨

This is where your game comes alive. "Juice" refers to all the small visual, audio, and tactile effects that make the game feel responsive and satisfying.

What to Write:
🔁 Feedback Loops
* Player presses a button → something reacts immediately
* Examples: sounds, animations, particles, camera shake

💬 Visual Feedback
* Flash on damage
* Smooth/Tweened movement
* Hit effects, popups, screen rumble

🔊 Audio Feedback
* Footsteps, UI clicks, item pickups
* Different sounds for success/failure
* Use AudioStreamPlayer2D for spatial effects

🧃 What Makes a Game “Juicy”
* Screenshake when landing or hitting
* Squash/stretch when jumping or bouncing
* Sound variations (pitch/volume changes)
* Floating text for score or damage

Juice doesn't need to be complex — just responsive and satisfying.
Add polish after the core gameplay is functional!
