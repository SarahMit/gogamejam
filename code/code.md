# Code
Gamejam code doesnâ€™t need to be perfect â€” it needs to be organized, modular, and fast to iterate on. While it's common to use quick and dirty solutions during a jam, it's still worth keeping your code at a level thatâ€™s manageable and readable â€” especially if youâ€™re working in a team.

This section isnâ€™t about best practices or perfect architecture. Instead, it offers simple, reusable patterns and practical examples to help new jammers implement the core systems most games need in a way thatâ€™s quick to build and easy to understand.

> This page is made for newcomers or less experienced jammers. Therefore, the approaches and examples focus on simplicity. As a more experienced programmer you might want to use more advanced and "cleaner" solutions.

This page will not dive into concrete programming languages. However, most examples will focus on the game engine [Godot](https://godotengine.org) ðŸ¤–, which is free and open-source, lightweight, and has a built-in scripting language, GDScript, which is similar to Python and therefore rather easy. 

## Choosing a Game Engine or Framework
If you are in a team with multiple programmers, you have to decide for a certain game engine or framework you want to build your game in. It might make sense to use tools you are already familiar with, but if you are okay with making a minimalistic or unfinished game, Game Jams are also a great opportunity to try out new things. 

This guide does not recommend one tool over another, as every tool has its own strengths and weaknesses. The best choice depends on your goals, experience, and preferences.

In general, game engines are a great option if you're not deeply into coding, as they handle many complex systems for you behind the scenes. Most engines allow you to write small, focused scripts and organize them within a visual editor. This interface lets you adjust parameters, structure scenes, and connect systems â€” often without writing a single line of code.

Modern engines also include built-in tools for animation, audio, UI, and asset management, supporting everything from 2D sprites to 3D models. Additionally, popular engines benefit from large, active communities, meaning you can often find solutions quickly through forums, tutorials, or videos.
