# What is a Game Manager?
A Game Manager is a central script or object that handles the high-level flow of your game, usually controlling:
* Game states: menu, playing, paused, game over
* Scene transitions
* Score, lives, or other persistent data
* Global settings like difficulty or audio
* Saving/loading

{: .note }
> It's often designed as a **singleton**, meaning there's only one instance of it that exists across the entire game.

--- 

## What Is the Singleton Pattern?
You want a single shared objectâ€”like a game manager thatâ€™s accessible from anywhere in the code, without making tons of copies. There's only one, and all the scripts check in with it. You don't want multiple instances giving conflicting instructions. In short:
* Only one instance is ever created
* Itâ€™s globally accessible
* Often initialized at the start of the program

### Singleton Pattern as Pseudocode
```
class SingletonClass:
    # Static variable to hold the one and only instance
    static instance = null

    # Private constructor to prevent direct instantiation
    private SingletonClass():
        // Initialize any variables or setup here

    # Public method to access the instance
    static get_instance():
        if instance == null:
            instance = new SingletonClass()
        return instance

    # Example method
    method do_something():
        print("Doing something...")
```

### How to access it in other Scripts
```
SingletonClass.get_instance().do_something()
```

## ðŸ¤– Godot's Approach
**Autoload** in Godot is how you typically implement singletons, but theyâ€™re not exactly the same thing. 
An Autoload is a node or script that is loaded once and kept alive across all scenes. It becomes globally accessible by name and behaves like a singleton. Check in with [Godot's documentation](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/latest/tutorials/scripting/singletons_autoload.html) to learn more.

## When to Use Singletons?
Usually singletons (or autoload) is the recommended way to implement global managers, e.g.:
* GameManager
* AudioManager
* InputHandler
* SaveSystem
* InventoryManager
