# Core Mechanics
The **core mechanic** is the *main action* the player performs over and over — the heart of your game. In a Game Jam, choosing a **simple, interesting, and expandable** core mechanic is one of the smartest decisions you can make.

## 💡 What Is a Core Mechanic?

It’s the **primary verb** in your game — what the player *does*:
* Jumping
* Shooting
* Switching gravity
* Drawing a path
* Possessing enemies
* Merging objects

Everything else — story, art, level design — builds around this action.

Ask yourself:
* Can I explain it in **one sentence**?
* Is it **fun to do repeatedly**?
* Can I build **at least 2–3 levels or challenges** with just this?

If yes, you’ve got a great candidate! Before adding art, menus, or sound — you might want to test if the core mechanic **feels good**. Use placeholder shapes and focus on movement and responsiveness.

> A platformer with double-jump is enough. You don’t need wall slides, dashes, and gliders on day one.
