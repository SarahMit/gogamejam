# Genre Ideas That Work Well
Some genres naturally fit the tight constraints of a Game Jam ‚Äî they're simple to prototype, easy for players to understand, and fun with just one or two mechanics.

Here are genres that work well in jams:

---

## üß± 1. Platformers
* Simple core mechanics (jump, run, collect)  
* Easy to build levels using tiles or modular pieces  
* Lots of room for creativity: gravity flip, double jump, time control

> Examples: *Celeste Classic*, *N++*, *You Have to Win the Game*

---

## üß© 2. Puzzle Games
* Often built around a single clever mechanic  
* Don‚Äôt require complex animations or AI  
* Players enjoy solving challenges, even in short bursts

> Examples: *Baba Is You*, *Sokoban*, *Portal*

---

## ‚¨áÔ∏è 3. Top-Down Arcade Games
* Simple control schemes (move + shoot/interact)  
* Good for twin-stick, shooter, survival, or collect-'em-ups  
* Easily scoped into short, high-score gameplay

> Examples: *Asteroids*, *Nuclear Throne*, *Luftrausers*

---

## ‚ôæÔ∏è 4. Endless Runners / Score Chasers
* One core loop with increasing difficulty  
* Easy to make "one more try" games  
* Good fit for mobile/web and simple controls

> Examples: *Canabalt*, *Flappy Bird*, *Dino Run*

---

## üõû 5. Turn-Based Games
* No need for complex real-time physics or animation  
* Great for strategy, roguelike, or puzzle hybrids  
* Easier to debug and test in a jam timeframe

> Examples: *Into the Breach*, *Mini Metro*, *Dicey Dungeons*

---

## üßô 6. Narrative or Dialogue-Driven Games
* Can be made with minimal mechanics  
* Focus on writing, choices, and atmosphere  

> Examples: *A Short Hike*, *Emily is Away*, *One Night Stand*

---

## üé≤ 7. Experimental or ‚ÄúWeird Mechanic‚Äù Games
* Jams are the perfect place to try risky, silly, or ‚Äúwhat if‚Äù ideas  
* The concept can be the whole hook  
* No expectations of balance or polish ‚Äî just surprise and delight

> Examples: *There Is No Game*, *QWOP*, *Everything is Going to Be OK*

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Genres That Are Tough for Game Jams
Avoid unless you're very experienced or ready to heavily simplify:
* Full 3D action/adventure games  
* Deep RPGs with inventories, quests, and dialogue trees  
* Multiplayer (especially networked)  
* Open-world exploration
* Point & Click Adventures (unless you have a lot of artists to make all the assets)
