Game design is not about graphics — it’s about defining the gameplay, mechanics, goals, characters, and player experience.

## What Makes a Good Jam Game?
A good jam game doesn’t need to be big — it needs to be clear, fun, and finishable. In a jam, the best games often do one thing very well, rather than trying to do everything.

Key traits are often:

1. One Clear, Well-Executed Idea
    * Focus on a single mechanic (e.g. jumping, rewinding time, switching colors).
    * Build your game around that idea — explore it in fun or unexpected ways.
    * Players should “get it” in the first 10 seconds.

2. Creative Use of the Theme
    * Stick to the jam’s theme in a unique or clever way — but don’t overthink it.
    * E.g., your mechanic, story, or twist can be theme-driven.

3. Polish Over Content
    * One tight, fun level > ten rushed ones.
    * Add feedback: sounds, particles, screen shake, UI effects.
    * A little “juice” goes a long way in making a game feel great.

2. Simple But Complete
    * It has a beginning, middle, and end, even if short.
    * It’s easy to understand without reading a manual.
    * All essential features work (menus, restart, win/lose conditions).

5. What Doesn’t Matter:
    * Fancy graphics
    * Custom engines
    * Long stories
    * Tons of features

## Scope & Time Management Tips
Game Jams are short — often just 48 or 72 hours — so managing your time and scope wisely is essential. Here’s how to stay productive and finish strong.

### 🎯 Start Small, Then Polish

**Focus on one core mechanic!**  
* Choose a simple idea that’s achievable in a few hours.
* If it’s your first jam, think *"Can I make a fun game with just this one mechanic?"*
* Extra features can come later — if there’s time.

> 💡 Example: A platformer with double-jump is enough. You don’t need wall slides, dashes, and gliders on day one.

### ⏳ Prioritize What the Player Sees First
* First impressions matter. Prioritize the **main game loop**, **movement**, and **feedback**.
* A single level that feels good is better than 10 unplayable ones.

### ✂️ Cut Features Early & Without Guilt

Be ruthless. If a feature isn’t essential to the core fun, cut it or move it to a “maybe later” list.

Ask yourself:
* Does this make the game more fun?
* Will the game still work without it?
* Can I replace it with something simpler?

### 🤝 Don’t Wait to Integrate
* Get your assets (art, audio) into the game early — even placeholders.
* Avoid doing “all code first, all art last” — balance both.
* If you're working in a team, communicate early and often.
* Merge game components from different team members on a regular basis.

✅ **Tip**: Always leave **at least 4–6 hours at the end** for debugging and exporting!
