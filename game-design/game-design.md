# Game Design
Game design is not about graphics — it’s about defining the gameplay, mechanics, goals, characters, and player experience.

## What Makes a Good Jam Game?
A good jam game doesn’t need to be big — it needs to be clear, fun, and finishable. In a jam, the best games often do one thing very well, rather than trying to do everything. Game Jams are short — often just 48 or 72 hours — so managing your time and scope wisely is essential. Here’s how to stay productive and finish strong:

### 🎯 One Clear, Well-Executed Idea
* Focus on a single core mechanic.
* Build your game around that idea — explore it in fun or unexpected ways.
* Players should “get it” in the first 10 seconds.
* Choose a simple idea that’s achievable in a few hours.
* Extra features can come later, if there’s time.

### ✂️ Cut Features Early & Without Guilt
* Does this make the game more fun?
* Will the game still work without it?
* Can I replace it with something simpler?
* Be ruthless, if a feature isn’t essential, cut it or move it to a “maybe later” list

### ✨ Polish Over Content
* One tight, fun level > ten rushed ones.
* Add feedback: sounds, particles, screen shake, UI effects.
* A little “juice” goes a long way in making a game feel great.

### ✅ Simple But Complete
* It has a beginning, middle, and end, even if short.
* It’s easy to understand without reading a manual.
* All essential features work (menus, restart, win/lose conditions).

### 🤝 Don’t Wait to Integrate
* Get your assets (art, audio) into the game early — even placeholders.
* Avoid doing “all code first, all art last” — balance both.
* If you're working in a team, communicate early and often.
* Merge game components from different team members on a regular basis.

### ❌ What Doesn’t Matter:
* Fancy graphics
* Custom engines
* Long stories
* Tons of features
